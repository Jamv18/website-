The justin-experiment folder holds content that makes a page that demos some p5.js hello world level code.

It is the result of this example starter code: https://p5js.org/tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/#vscode
and the p5.js VS Code extension. 

These p5.js "how to" instructions were used to install the p5.js extension on VS Code: https://p5js.org/tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/#vscode.
